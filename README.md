# JSON Linter

> Ruby is a beautiful programming language that was designed for programmer productivity. It comes feature-packed with numerous inbuilt classes and methods to make programming enjoyable for developers.
>
> According to Wikipedia, JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format. It uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects. JSON files consist of attribute-value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).
>
> In today's development world, JSON is one of the popular data formats. Although it was derived from JavaScript, it a language-independent format. Many languages come with an inbuilt JSON parser. It is also a light-weight format and, it is human-readable.
>
> This project aims to use some of Ruby's inbuilt methods to build a JSON linter. The project will continue to evolve and be updated. I hope you find it helpful.
